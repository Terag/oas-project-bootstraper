# The `openapi` folder

This folder contains your entrypoint `openapi.yaml`.

That file contains references to the entire API definition.

Here are some sections to pay attention to:

* info: general information regarding your API
* Security schemes: you will define the scheme(s) your API uses for security (eg OAuth2, OpenID, ClientId/Secret, HMAC, etc...).
* [Paths](paths/README.md): this defines each endpoint.  A path can have one operation per http method.
* Tags: it's a good idea to organize each operation. Each tag can have a description. The description is used as a section description within the reference docs.
* Servers: a list of your servers, each with a URL.
